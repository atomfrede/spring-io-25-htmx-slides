== Conclusion

== Does it spark joy?

* removed a lot of complexity
* pushed the barrier for SPAs further
* ability to move faster (no contracts)
* invest in long living, framework agnostic tech(niques)
* team(s) are not split

== When to use it?

* Form based applications (aka "enterprise" applications)
* CRUD
* e-commerce
* Nested UI elements, controlled updates
* Must use *hypermedia exchanges* as primary communication

[.notes]
--
* "uncontrolled" or unrestricted updates may lead to jquery like issues
--

== And when not to use it?

* Offline requirement
* Many dynamic, interdependent UI elements
* Updated very frequently (e.g. Miro)
* Be aware of certain security implications
** CSP, hx-on/trigger, XSS, HTML injection
* Combine approaches ("dynamic islands")

[.notes]
--
* most of the time, starting with hypermedia is good enough
* think of the team structure --> full stack
* using hypermedia as the main driver and use SPAs or similar when needed
** we have a classical ssr application but one part is using a js framework to enable drawing of graphs and move them around

* Wim shows how to build hypermedia driven applications with spring boot with ease
* Hypermedia builds the foundation and concepts building different examples with python and flask
* both are very valueable reads
* Wim contacted me this morning and you can get a 20% discount just for Spring I/O!
