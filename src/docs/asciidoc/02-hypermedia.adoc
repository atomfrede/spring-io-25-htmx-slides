== What is hypermedia?

[quote,Ted Nelson]
____
Hypertexts: New forms of writing, appearing on computer screens, that will *branch* or perform at the readerâ€™s command. A hypertext is a *non-sequential piece of writing*; only the computer display makes it practical.
____

== History lesson

* Ted Nelson coined the term footnote:hypertext[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext] in 1963 footnote:ted[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson]
* *Non-linear branching model*
* Project Xanadu footnote:xanadu[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu]
* Can be traced back to the 40ties and the idea of the memex footnote:memex[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex]

* Ted Nelson was a visionary of computer human interaction
* I learned about his concepts at university
* Project xanadu envisioned a lot concepts picked up by other technologies
* But it strived for perfection and was too academic
* In 1968 Douglas Engelbart from Stanford showed a demo (memex) of what we today take for granted
** Remote Collaborative Text Editing
** Video, Audio Chat
** An underlined hypertext, clicking it navigated to the linked content

== Fast Forward...

* 1990 Tim Berners-Lee published the first website
* HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
* Hyperlinks between documents
* Forms where *not part* of the initial HTML (readonly)
* Anchors and forms have been enough to make the web grow rapidly

[.notes]
--
* HTML is omnipresent today
* After forms came up the web transformed from a document oriented system to a system architecture
* Think of wikipedia as the prime example of hypertext/hypermedia system
* The web as such is really simple

== Hypermedia driven applications

[quote]
____
A web application that uses *hypermedia* and *hypermedia exchanges* as its primary mechanism for communicating with a server.
____

--
* So we must exhange HTML documents/snippets
* Everything has an url
* The response ca just be rendered no need of the client to have any up front knowledge
--

== HTML stopped to evolve as hypermedia/hypertext

1. Why should only `<a>` and `<form>` be able to make HTTP requests?
2. Why should only `click` and `submit` events trigger a request?
3. Why should only `GET` and `POST` be allowed?
4. Why should only the entire screen be replaced?

* These missing features makes it hard to build modern hypermedia drive applications
