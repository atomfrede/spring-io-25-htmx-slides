== HTMX

[quote,HTMX]
____
By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext
____

* small js-library (~14k)
* simplifies AJAX, WebSockets, Server Send Events
* access all the features declaratively via HTML attributes
* server answers with (partial) HTML

== HTMX Attributes

* Small set of essential attributes
[%steps]
* `hx-get|post|put|delete`
* `hx-target`
* `hx-trigger`
* `hx-swap`

== HTMX

[source,html,highlight="2,3,4,5"]
----
<button
    hx-post="/clicked"
    hx-trigger="click"
    hx-target="#parent-div"
    hx-swap="outerHTML">
    Click Me!
</button>
----

== JTE

* There are a lot of template engines for java/the jvm
* Most of them are very mature
* But nearly none of them is typesafe
* Many use reflection
* *does it spark joy?*

[.notes]
--
* Without type safety refactoring becomes a nightmare
* can't see what a page really needs
* reflection does not play well with native images/graal vm
* alternatives e.g. JStachio when you would like to use a known template syntax
* thymeleaf for feature rich and widespread support
* qute for quarkus applications

== JTE

[source,html]
----
@import org.example.Page

@param Page page

<head>
    @if(page.getDescription() != null)
        <meta name="description" content="${page.getDescription()}">
    @endif
    <title>${page.getTitle()}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${page.getTitle()}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my example page!</p>
</body>
----

== HOWL - Hypermedia on whatever you like

* Thymeleaf - the feature-rich classic
* JStachio - typesafe, fast mustache
* HTMLFLow - DSL approach (better use kotlin)
* kotlinx.html - Pure kotlin
* Qute - the quarkus one
* Spring ViewComponents

[.notes]
--
* it should support "fragments", partial HTML with ease
* typesafe is better
* ViewComponents: UI Components build on server side using JTE (Thymeleaf)
* DSL approach looks promising
--

== Client-side state/scripting?

* Plain/VanillaJS
* alpine.js
* stimulus (hotwired)

[.notes]
--
* sometimes client side state/scripting is needed
* e.g. dropdowns
* alpine fits well declaratively
* stimulus controller + declaratively application
