____
By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext

* simplifies AJAX, WebSockets, Server Send Events
* access all the features declaratively via HTML attributes
* server answers with (partial) HTML

== JTE

* There are a lot of template engines for java/the jvm
* Most of them are very mature
* But nearly none of them is typesafe
* Many use reflection
* *does it spark joy?*

[.notes]
--
* Without type safety refactoring becomes a nightmare
* can't see what a page really needs
* reflection does not play well with native images/graal vm
* alternatives e.g. JStachio when you would like to use a known template syntax
* thymeleaf for feature rich and widespread support
* qute for quarkus applications

@import org.example.Page

@param Page page

<head>
    @if(page.getDescription() != null)
        <meta name="description" content="${page.getDescription()}">
    @endif
    <title>${page.getTitle()}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${page.getTitle()}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my example page!</p>

== HOWL - Hypermedia on whatever you like

* Thymeleaf - the classic
* JStachio - typesafe, extremely fast mustache
* HTMLFLow - DSL approach (better use kotlin)
* kotlinx.html - Pure kotlin
* Qute - the quarkus one
